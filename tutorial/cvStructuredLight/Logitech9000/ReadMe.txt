Introduction
============

This C++ sample tool demonstrates how to access extension unit controls through DirectShow
in order to control raw mode ("Bayer mode") of Logitech QuickCam UVC camera devices.

There is a how-to article with more details to go with this sample. You can find it here:

Notes
=====

Please read the mentioned how-to article to get familiar with the features and limitations
of this tool. In particular, keep in mind the following important points:

- Settings changed with this tool does not have any effect while the camera is streaming video.
  The video stream must be restarted for the settings to take effect.

- Raw mode only works in certain resolutions. For 1.3 MP cameras, those will usually be the
  camera's "native" resolutions, i.e. 960x720 or 1280x960. For 2 MP cameras more resolutions
  may be supported. If color processing is disabled (i.e. "Bayer mode" is enabled) and
  streaming is started in a not supported resolution, the camera sends no data and the
  application may appear to hang. If this happens, just choose another resolution.

- If Bayer images are captured in any resolution lower than the maximum resolution supported
  by the sensor, clipping occurs. For example, if the sensor supports 1280x960 and a 960x720
  image is recorded, the frame will appear clipped at the right and lower borders.
